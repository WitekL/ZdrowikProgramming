This app has been made for fun mostly because its purpose is to encoureage my lazy friend to start programming. By
the way I can test few new things out and learn something useful.

In development of this app I learned few useful things:
- ActionMailer and its configuration
- What are cron jobs
- Managing my Heroku account and containers
- Preparing app for production
